- Find the changes I made in the big project (files: `big_poject1.zip` vs `big_poject2.zip`) → I didn’t compile it so the PDF will look the same.
- How many times does the word "Tagblatt" appear in the files `corpus1.txt`, `corpus2.txt`, and `corpus3.txt`? Count only the lines.
- Count all the lines and instances where the whole article "die" appears in these 3 files. Capitalization is not important, i.e. Die OK, Dieser not OK
- What are the differences between `corpus2.txt` and `corpus3.txt`?
