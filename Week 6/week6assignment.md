# Assignment Week 6

**Make 10 plots overall.**

9 plots should visualize the data from the two in-class experiments. These plots should follow the WCOG guidelines and show different aspects of the data (e.g. only one condition, only one interest area) Do not make 3 plots that show the same thing, e.g. three times the mean acceptability rating between conditions.

- 3 plots for the Moses illusion data (line, point, and bar),
- 3 plots for the noisy channel reading time data (line, point, and bar), and
- 3 plots for the noisy channel acceptability rating data (line, point, and bar).

You can use hybrid plots as well.

The last plot can be based on any dataset you want and be in any shape you want. It has to be ugly, unreadable, and violate as many WCOG guidelines as it can.

If you use a dataset outside of the two experiments in class, please upload it with your script file.
