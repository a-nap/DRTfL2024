# Digital Research Toolkit for Linguists

Author: `anna.pryslopska[ AT ]ling.uni-stuttgart.de`

These are the original materials from the course "Digital Research Toolkit for Linguists taught by me in the Summer Semester 2024 at the University of Stuttgart.
The materials will be updated weekly. Identifying information of the in-class participants will be removed, so some slides, data or exercises may be missing.

You are more than welcome to follow along but I will not be able to grade or evaluate your homework.

If you want to replicate this course, you can do so with
proper attribution. To replicate the data, follow these links for [Experiment 1](https://farm.pcibex.net/r/CuZHnp/) (full Moses illusion experiment) and [Experiment 2](https://farm.pcibex.net/r/zAxKiw/) (demo of self-paced reading with acceptability judgment).

## Course description

This seminar provides a gentle, hands-on introduction to the essential tools for quantitative research for students of linguistics and the humanities overall. During the course of the seminar, the students will familiarize themselves with software that is rarely taught but is invaluable in developing an efficient, transparent, reusable, and scalable research workflow (e.g. R basics, LaTeX, git). From text file, through data visualization, to creating beautiful reports: this course will empower students to improve their skill and help them establish good practices.

The seminar is targeted at **students with little to no experience with programming**. It provides key skills that are useful for research and industry jobs.

We will cover topics such as:  
✔ How can I make sense of my data?  
✔ How can I communicate what I found?  
✔ How do I share my data and collaborate with others?  

We will NOT cover topics such as:  
❌ Experiment design  
❌ Inferential statistics  
❌ Cognitive modelling  
❌ Corpus research
