# Assignment Week 14

Upload a plain text file about how far you got with #2.

1. Make a new git repository for the project we worked on this semester (Moses illusion, noisy channel, and the related files). Add a readme file, then add the R files, the Quarto files, and the LaTeX files AS INDIVIDUAL COMMITS. Include only the necessary files (omit redundant files). You should have at least 4 commits. Write meaningful commit messages.
2. Attempt this exercise and report on how far you got with it: [Bandit](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit0.html)
