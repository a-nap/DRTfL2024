# Assignment Week 9

Submit two files in which you report on the Moses illusion experiment: a Quarto file (`.qmd`) and an HTML file (`.html`). The Quarto file should have all the code, text, and markup. The HTML file should look like **a beautiful report with no unnecessary code or output.** Treat it like a report or presentation, but be very brief; this is not a term paper.

- Keep all the code you need for analyzing and visualizing the data.
- Make at least one table.
- Make at least one list.
- Include at least one plot of the data.
- Reference the table, list, and plot in the report text by hyperlinking/cross-referencing.
- Include the session info in full.

Your Quarto file should include ALL code needed to generate the data. That means you need to include everything from start to finish, so also the code for **loading the packages and data**. Then all the code for preprocessing and generating tables, plots, etc.
