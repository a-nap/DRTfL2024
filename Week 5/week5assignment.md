# Assignment Week 5

## Read and preprocess the new Moses illusion data (`moses_clean.csv`)

1. Calculate the percentage of "correct", "incorrect", and "don't know" answers in the two critical conditions.
2. Of all the questions in all conditions, which question was the easiest and which was the hardest?
3. Of the Moses illusion questions, which question fooled most people?
4. Which participant was the best in answering questions? Who was the worst?

## Read and inspect the updated new noisy channel data (`noisy_rt.csv` and `noisy_aj.csv`).

1. **Acceptability judgment data:** Calculate the mean rating in each condition. How was the data spread out? Did the participants rate the sentences differently?
2. **Reading times:** calculate the average length people spent reading each sentence fragment in each condition. Did the participant read the sentences differently in each condition?
3. Make one data frame out of both data frames. Keep all the information but remove redundancy.
