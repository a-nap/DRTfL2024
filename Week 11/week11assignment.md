# Assignment Week 10

Re-create the Moses illusion report in LaTeX (don't worry about proper citations). Upload all the files needed for compiling your report (obligatorily the TEX file, but also plots) and the PDF report file.

- Include at least one table and one figure of the data (with captions).
- Reference and hyperlink the table and figure in the text.
- Create one list (via itemize, enumerate, or exe).
- Make one gloss (e.g. translate a question from the experiment to your native language).
- Make one syntactic tree.
- Make one semantic formula.
- Preserve the scientific article structure (Background, methods, results, etc.).
- Include a table of contents.
